Communicate ALL the things in ALL the places
--------------------------

Sysadmins like communication:
- We like knowing what is going on and we really like knowing before it wakes 
  us up at 3am. 
- We like to have a clear and predicatable location for documentation and we 
  like the status of things to be painfully obvious. 
- We like it better if we have to walk right past the documentation when we
  are diagnosing the problem.
- We like search. 

Unfortunately, so rare is it to find all of these things to be true.

*What is good communication?*

Communication should be like good road signage. It should tell me 
what I need to know far enough in advance that I can prepare for it
and remind me about it often, and before it's too late. It should
be detailed enough to get the point across, but brief enough that
I can read it in a hurry. I should not have to use define: in google
to interpret it. 

Most importantly, I shouldn't have to spend a lot of time finding it. It
should be there staring at me when I go to look at the problem. 

Pop the hood on any car and you'll see an example of this - documentation,
right there, all the stuff you are most likely to care about when you are
looking under the hood (pitty they don't make use of more of that real estate
really).
